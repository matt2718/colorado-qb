title: "Welcome to Colorado QB!"

<p>
  We started in the summer of 2017, when several members of the CU Boulder team
  saw a need for a Colorado-specific quizbowl resource center and organizational
  body, in order to support the state's growing pyramidal quiz bowl circuit.
  Today, we're an association of college and high school players with an
  interest in expanding the game.
