  We are a Colorado-specific quizbowl resource center and organizational
  body working to support the state's growing pyramidal quiz bowl circuit.
  Our network of college and high school quiz bowl players, alumni, and coaches 
  work together to expand the game and send competing teams to tournaments nationwide.
