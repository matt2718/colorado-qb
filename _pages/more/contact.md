We started in the summer of 2017, when several members of the CU Boulder team
saw a need for a Colorado-specific quizbowl resource center and organizational
body, in order to support the state's growing pyramidal quiz bowl circuit.
Today, we're an association of college and high school players with an
interest in expanding the game.
