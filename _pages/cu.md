## NOTE: The CU Boulder team no longer exists. If you're a CU student and you want to restart it, please email me (matt at coloradoqb.org) and I'll give you control of this website.

Hi! We're CU Boulder's quiz bowl team! We compete against other
colleges in a buzzer-based game that tests academic knowledge. We've
played tournaments everywhere from Kansas to Utah to Idaho to
Illinois. Outside of the college game, we also host high school quiz
bowl tournaments and attend various academic and cultural events on
campus. If you're a CU student who'd like to explore new subjects in a
community of like-minded, intellectually curious people, quiz bowl is
for you!
