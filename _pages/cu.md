Hi! We're CU Boulder's quiz bowl team! We compete against other
colleges in a buzzer-based game that tests academic knowledge. We've
played tournaments everywhere from Kansas to Utah to Idaho to
Illinois. Outside of the college game, we also host high school quiz
bowl tournaments and attends various academic and cultural events on
campus. If you're a CU student who'd like to explore new subjects in a
community of like-minded, intellectually curious people, quiz bowl is
for you!

Want to learn more about the game? Check out [the rest of this
website](/info/what-is-qb/).

Practices during the 2019 fall semester are on **Wednesday evenings,
from 6:15 PM - 9 PM, in Hellems 196**. Feel free to stop by! If you
have any questions about the team, feel free to email club president
Matt Mitchell (<matthew.s.mitchell@colorado.edu>).
