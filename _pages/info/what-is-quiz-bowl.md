Quiz bowl (sometimes spelled "quizbowl") is a quiz game played between two
teams, in which players are challenged to answer questions about a variety of
academic subjects.  It is played at middle school, high school, and collegiate
levels. The game bears a passing resemblance to televised quiz shows like
*Jeopardy*, but has several [important differences](/info/pyramidal).

Though the term "quiz bowl" sometimes refers to buzzer-based academic
competitions in general, it usually denotes a specific [tossup-bonus format](
