Quiz bowl is a quiz game played between at least two teams challenged to answer
questions about a variety of academic subjects. It is often the game that comes
to mind in pop culture when one thinks of quiz games, with variations of the game
being broadcast on television and radio for the last fifty years, including the
famous CBS show *College Bowl* and most recently on the Canadian *Reach for the Top*
and the UK's *University Challenge*. The game as it is played today
originated in 1953, and variations are played at the elementary school level through
the university level. Players are given lockout-style buzzers, meaning that the first
to buzz is the first to answer. Teams are made up of typically four to five members
with questions read by a moderator.

The questions themselves are about a variety of subjects, striking a balance
between rigorous academic questions and questions about current events and popular
culture, encouraging teams to be made up of players with diverse backgrounds.
