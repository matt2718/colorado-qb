Quiz bowl is a quiz game played between at least two teams challenged to answer
questions about a variety of academic subjects. It is often the game that comes
to mind in pop culture when one thinks of quiz games, with variations of the game
being broadcast on television and radio for the last fifty years, including the
famous CBS show *College Bowl* and most recently on the Canadian *Reach for the Top*
and the UK's *University Challenge*. The game as it is played today
originated in 1953, and variations are played at the elementary school level through
the university level. Players are given lockout-style buzzers, meaning that the first
to buzz is the first to answer. Teams are made up of typically four to five members
with questions read by a moderator.

The questions themselves are about a variety of subjects, striking a balance
between rigorous academic questions and questions about current events and popular
culture, encouraging teams to be made up of players with diverse backgrounds.

There are two types of questions- toss-ups and bonuses. While the toss-up is read
players are not to communicate with each other. An individual answers as soon
as they feel they are ready to respond by using their buzzer. If the player is
incorrect, their team members cannot buzz and answer for their team. Further, a
five-point deduction is made, called "negging". Further, after a "neg" has occurred
no other team will be penalized and the question continues to be read. If a correct
answer is given, points are awarded. In the NAQT (National Academic Quiz Tournaments)
variant there are powers, meaning that 15 points are awarded if the answer is given
before a predetermined point in the question and 10 if the question is correctly
answered after that point. Questions in this quiz format are pyramidal, meaning
that as the question continues the clues will become increasingly easy. More information
can be found about this on the [Pyramidal Questions](http://coloradoqb.org/info/pyramidal/)
page. This system rewards players with the most knowledge as it gives them a greater
opportunity to answer first as well as to earn more points for their team. Games
consist of two nine-minute halves and a total of 24 toss-ups.

Bonuses are an important part of play that add extra incentive to answering the
toss-up correctly. The team that answered the toss-up correctly gets to answer a
set of three bonus questions that only their team is allowed to answer. Each part of
the bonus question can earn that team an extra ten points if answered correctly,
for a total of 30 possible points.
