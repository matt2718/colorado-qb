*NOTE: In addition to this page, we recommend reading NAQT's
[guides](https://www.naqt.com/resources/development.html) for new teams, as well
as this [article](https://gpqb.wordpress.com/how-do-i-start-a-quiz-bowl-team/)
by Greater Pennsylvania Quiz Bowl*

Starting a team is easy! Just get some interested players together, find some
[packets](quizbowlpackets.com) to practice on, and find out when the next
[tournament](/tournaments/upcoming) is.

If you have any questions, please contact us at
<info@coloradoqb.org>. We're happy to help, and if possible, we can
send out a current player to help you get set up.

## Questions

The [packet archives](quizbowlpackets.com) is a virtually unlimited source of
free, high-quality practice material for all levels of quiz bowl. [This
guide](https://cbreach.wordpress.com/packet-categorization/) provides an
excellent (albeit slightly dated) overview of various sets' difficulty.

[NAQT](https://www.naqt.com/practice-questions.jsp) also sells their
old questions as practice material.

## Coaches/Advisors

High school and middle school teams generally need a teacher or parent to handle
administrative tasks, coordinate transportation, and take responsibility for the
players.

Many college teams entirely are student-run, but a faculty advisor can help with
many administrative aspects of running a team.

## Buzzers

While not strictly necessary, a buzzer system is highly recommended for any
team. Buzzers make practice more lively and more like an actual tournament
match. In addition, quiz bowl tournaments offer discounts for teams that bring
buzzers.

Here are some points to keep in mind when buying a buzzer system:

* Many tournaments require wired systems and will not give discounts for
  wireless ones (due to the potential for lag).
* Avoid systems without lights on the individual buzzers. These require the
  moderator to verbally recognize each player before they answer, which slows
  down games.
* Battery powered systems may fail during tournaments; it's better to buy a
  plug-in one.

The most commonly recommended system is the [Anderson
Officiator](http://www.andersonbuzzersystems.com/tabletop.html). It's easy to
set up, reliable, and relatively inexpensive.

If your team has difficulty affording a buzzer system, check out [Matt's
Buzzers](http://mattsbuzzers.com/Home.php).

## Finding Tournaments

COQB keeps an [list](/tournaments/upcoming) of all upcoming
tournaments in Colorado. Announcements can also be found on the HSQB
[forums](http://hsquizbowl.org/forums/index.php) and [tournament
database](http://hsquizbowl.org/db/).

Greater Pennsylvania Quiz Bowl has a useful [guide](https://gpqb.wordpress.com/
2015/06/28/going-to-quizbowl-tournaments-how-it-works/) for teams attending
their first tournament.

## Funding

Fortunately, quiz bowl far is cheaper than most interscholastic
competitions. Most tournaments have affordable entrance fees, and many will
offer discounts to new teams. However, as expenses add up over time (especially
for teams that wish to attend national tournaments), many teams will need to
fundraise. For experienced teams, [hosting a tournament](/tournaments/hosting)
is a great way to do this. In addition, many colleges (and possibly some high
schools) allow student groups to apply for funding.
