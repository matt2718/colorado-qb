Missouri Quizbowl Alliance*

Questions used in high quality quiz bowl formats contain multiple clues,
beginning with the more obscure clues and containing several progressively
easier, yet unambiguous, clues about the same answer, and ending with the most
well-known clues. By arranging clues this way, more knowledgeable teams have a
better chance of answering a question on a more obscure clue before an easier
clue that both teams know is read, while the inclusion of well-known facts at
the end of the question keep it accessible to a wide variety of teams.

The advantages of pyramidal questions can be best demonstrated with a comparison
of the two types of questions. Here is a typical example of a **non-pyramidal**
question ("Tossup 1"):

> What novel about Billy Pilgrim was written by Kurt Vonnegut?
>
> ANSWER: **Slaughterhouse-Five**

The first substantial clue (Billy Pilgrim), combined with knowing that the
answer is a novel, will immediately result in every player who is familiar with
Billy Pilgrim trying to buzz in simultaneously, devolving the question into a
buzzer race. Anybody who has studied a list of literary protagonists would have
the same chance of answering the question as someone who has read
*Slaughterhouse-Five* or someone who has studied Vonnegut's works.

The biggest flaw with this type of question is that it *rewards the player who
most quickly presses the buzzer, and not the player who knows more about the
subject.* The goal of quiz bowl is to reward knowledge, but when short questions
like this are used, it gives teams with better reflexes an unfair advantage.
Additionally, while it is very difficult for a person to improve reflexes, a
dedicated player has the potential to improve significantly when the game is
based on knowledge and not speed.

Compare that question to this better-written **pyramidal** question ("Tossup
2"):

> The protagonist of this novel marries Valencia Merble, the daughter of the
  founder of the optometry school he attended. He is kidnapped by aliens who
  look like toilet plungers; they take him to their home planet,
  Tralfamadore. Other events in this story include a description of the
  firebombing of Dresden during World War II. For ten points, identify this
  novel in which Billy Pilgrim becomes "unstuck in time," written by Kurt
  Vonnegut.
>
> ANSWER: **Slaughterhouse-Five**

This question uses several clues ordered by decreasing difficulty to reward more
knowledgeable players. A player who has read *Slaughterhouse-Five* might be able
to answer the question very early due to their deep familiarity with the
work. An experienced quiz bowl player who hasn't read it would have a better
chance of knowing that Slaughterhouse-Five includes a depiction of the
firebombing of Dresden, because it is a common clue in questions about the
work. Finally, the question ends with a giveaway clue that makes it most
accessible, so even a player with little literature knowledge might have a shot
if nobody has answered the question by that point.

Note that the giveaway clue in Tossup 2 contains the entirety of Tossup 1;
therefore, pyramidal questions are NOT more difficult than one-liners, because
they contain accessible clues at the end. In reality, it is shorter questions
that have greater potential to be more difficult. When questions are short, the
only way to write different questions on the same topic is to use entirely
different clues, and when there are only one or two well-known clues about a
topic, a writer will use more obscure clues that are less accessible, resulting
in more questions going unanswered.

Another benefit of the pyramidal style is that questions include a good amount
of information that players may not know; consequently, not only do pyramidal
questions fairly gauge a player's current knowledge, it also provides
significant opportunities for players to learn something from the questions. A
player who hears this *Slaughterhouse-Five* question might remember some of the
plot details and be rewarded the next time a question with a similar clue
appears, or might find one of the many clues interesting and decide to read the
novel as a result.

There are several other stylistic benefits to players found in high quality
questions:

* **Non-reliance on useless clues.** Clues that are purely trivia or otherwise
  useless to players are avoided in favor of more pertinent academic clues.
* **Less ambiguity.** Every clue in a pyramidal question points unambiguously to the
  same answer, and the type of answer sought is made clear early in the question
  by adherence to the "pronoun rule". By ensuring that the first pronoun in the
  question refers to the answer, there is no ambiguity in determining what the
  question is asking. For instance, a good question would use a phrase like
  "this work" in the first clue to indicate that the answer is a literary work,
  or start with a phrase like "He wrote about..." to indicate that the answer
  sought is a person.
* **No left-turns or other trickery.** Similar to reduction of ambiguity is the
  absence of tricks like left-turn questions that entice players to answer
  incorrectly. For instance, a bad question might describe a literary work,
  leading a player to buzz in and name the work. To the player's surprise, they
  answer is ruled incorrect. A few words later, the question finishes with "Name
  the author of" the work that was described. "Left-turn" questions like this
  are insulting to players.

To summarize, pyramidal questions help lead players to the correct answer by
using a series of useful clues that fairly reward more knowledgeable teams,
while providing opportunities for players to improve simply by playing more
questions.

## Common Misconceptions About Pyramidal Questions

To fully understand the benefits of using pyramidal questions, it is important
to understand what pyramidal questions are NOT:

* **Pyramidal questions are not necessarily harder than shorter questions with
  fewer clues.** While the first few clues of a pyramidal question are designed
  to be difficult, the last few clues are designed to reward anyone with even a
  cursory knowledge of the topic. In contrast, shorter tossups tend to feature
  increasingly obscure "giveaways" to avoid asking the exact same question ad
  nauseum. As a result, one can argue that pyramidal questions are, on average,
  actually easier than shorter tossups.
* **A long question is not necessarily a pyramidal question.** A tossup on
  Abraham Lincoln that begins "This sixteenth president of the United States..."
  and goes on to devote three or four sentences to clues about his early
  political career is not a pyramidal question because its clues are not
  arranged in order of decreasing obscurity. Likewise, a question that resembles
  a dissertation on the role of rivers in the development of civilizations and
  ends by asking for the longest river in South America is not pyramidal because
  the body of the question does not unambiguously refer to the Amazon.
* **Well-written pyramidal questions are not long for the sake of being long.**
  Well-written pyramidal questions pack in as many meaningful, uniquely
  identifying, and interesting clues as possible without sacrificing grammar and
  syntax.
